- "fix" UI style change between portrait/landscape on tablet (this is really a design decision but think this design works better and 
it also fixes bad back button behavior and losing detail view on rotate).
- "fix" the back stack behavior of back button. This might be intentional but it does not match google GMS app behavior. And it introduces
confusion (in my opinion) and some UI challenges. Remove the back stack behavior (don't ever go more than 2 deep).
- fix overdraw on detail view when there is no network (have a valid image web url but can't load it)
- fix title bar changing when rotating/suspend. TO BE CLEAR - when nav tray open will be app name. After selection, goes to subfunction name
- preserve 2nd pane visibility through rotate/suspend.
- fix landscape button layout on add book
